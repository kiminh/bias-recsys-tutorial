A Python toolbox for experimenting with data and algorithmic bias in recommender systems. 

## Installation

## Getting Started

## Contribution
This code is provided for educational purposes and aims to facilitate reproduction of our results, and further research 
in this direction. We have done our best to document, refactor, and test the code before the tutorial.

If you find any bugs or would like to contribute new models, training protocols, etc, please let us know.

Please feel free to file issues and pull requests on the repo and we will address them as we can.
